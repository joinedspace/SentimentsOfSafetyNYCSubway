<h2>The Media</h2>
<p>
For this study, the New York Times is used as a proxy for institutional media writ large. The authors acknowledge the limitations of this choice. In a wider endeavor, the perspectives of other journalistic outlets would be considered. Here, the Times is chosen because of its ubiquitous and purported neutral stance (whether or not this is valid is debatable).

In order to systematically create an overview of Subway sentiment, every archived local or regional New York Times article published between January 2022 and April 2025 is scanned via their API (LINK), and the following key metadata are saved to a table: timestamp of publication, headline, abstract, and banner image URL. From this collection, articles whose headline or abstract contain the word “Subway”, “MTA”, or “transit”, are saved as a subset. Then, headlines from this subset are manually combed through and tagged if they seem to stoke a sentiment of fear. This designation comes from an admittedly subjective heuristic of emotional response. Generally though, if a violent act or other mention of public safety is present in a headline, it is marked. 

A time series collapsed bar chart visualizes this media data, and select callouts earmark some of the more sensationalized stories of the last few years. It is perhaps no surprise that the isolated and horrific acts of violence have more sustained news cycles and eye-catching headlines. The widest blocks of orange in the companion visualization tend to follow such stories. In contrast, sparser media coverage follows policy announcements around increased police in the transit system, the deployment of the National Guard, and even the Sep 15th, 2024 incident where police opened fire at a Brooklyn station, gravely injuring an uninvolved bystander. Many orange streaks following this latter incident are unrelated to it; rather, they are court appearance rehashings of the May 1st, 2023 murder of Jordan Neely. 

Daniel Penny was acquitted of all charges and widely celebrated by factions of the right for his self-claimed neutralizing of a public threat (REFERENCE). The truth is that Jordan Neely was the exact victim of systemic discard that rendered him vulnerable to public hatred (https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/12/jordan-neely-new-york-social-services-support-mental-health). While “mentally ill people are more likely to be the victim of a violent crime than to commit one” (https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/20/nyregion/nyc-mental-illness-breakdowns.html), the rhetoric has fully re-embraced broken-windows theory. For instance, Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez has said “quality-of-life issues, when left unaddressed, can erode public confidence and fuel a sense of disorder,” (REFERENCE), and it is exactly that word, disorder, that seems to be the media’s master key into facilitating the paradox of simultaneous increases in police presence and alleged decreases in violent incidents according to the NYPD. 

The Dec 22nd, 2024 killing of Debrina Kawam by fire was in a sense the culmination of manufactured public sentiment that had been festering since the worst of COVID lifted. Some painted her as the face of the unhoused and parroted the sentiment that people using the Subway system for shelter should be forcibly removed. Others used the Guatemalan perpetrator as an excuse for a larger diatribe against Latin American migrant populations. 

In both Neely and Kawam’s cases, it is clear that the media capitalized on the magnitude of the event, stoking slippery and unproductive public discourse, and doing nothing to foster a forum of dialogue around modern policing and its dearth of compassionate methods.

<h2>Police Activity</h2>
<p>
Arrests are taken to be a proxy for police activity in this study, because other ancillary citizen information is either out of date or unavailable. This is a systemic limitation. Arrest data spanning 2022 through 2024 are downloaded from the NYPD’s data portal (REFERENCE) as well as the City of New York’s historical arrest records (REFERENCE). These are stitched together in ascending order and filtered to the subset of arrests where the jurisdiction code is 1.0, signifying transit. These transit records are then categorized into quality-of-life (comprising violations and misdemeanors) and felony arrests.

Dividing the arrest count by the MTA’s averaged daily ridership volume (REFERENCE) between 2022 and 2024 normalizes patterns across the city. This aggregation is performed at the community district level to strike a balance between data point counts and granularity. After further roll-ups to month-level precision, we generate a time series choropleth of both quality-of-life and felony arrests across our 36-month study window. 

The number of quality-of-life arrests broadly increases across community districts over time. This is most pronounced in areas like East Brooklyn or the South Bronx, which are already sites of perpetual disinvestment (REFERENCE). They are also geographically far from the high-traffic stations of Manhattan Hochul so keenly deployed the National Guard to (REFERENCE).

According to the data, quality-of-life arrests went up 77% from 2022 (4864) to 2023 (8617) and 96% from 2023 to 2024 (16929) respectively, citywide. At the same time, felony arrests went up 29% from 2022 (1834) to 2023 (2374) and 22% 2023 to 2024 (2887). Given Subway ridership has been between 1 and 1.2 billion yearly since 2022 (REFERENCE), the relatively accelerated progression in policing statistics is notable. In addition, it is bizarre that the official crime statistics offered by the MTA (https://www.mta.info/document/131556) deviate from tabulations of the raw NYPD records. Looking only at felonies between 2023 and 2024, their summary claims a decrease from 2337 to 2211, while this study tallies an increase from 2374 to 2887. 

Because the MTA’s summary statistics do not offer a definition of “crime”, these incongruences are likely not methodically resolvable. They do add to a concerning trend of data cherry-picking by the NYPD in their high-level reporting (REFERENCE).
